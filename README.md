# SMS-Classifier

# Project Summary
This data science project focuses on developing a text classification model to classify Short Message Service (SMS) messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). With the rise of text-based communication, identifying and filtering out spam messages has become crucial. The dataset used for this project contains labeled examples of SMS messages, allowing us to build and train a machine learning model for accurate spam detection.

# Objectives
Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the SMS dataset, the distribution of spam and non-spam messages, and potential features for classification.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and handling any noisy or irrelevant information.

Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to make it suitable for machine learning models.

Model Selection: Experiment with various text classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to determine the most effective model.

Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed SMS dataset, using a portion of the data for training and another for validation.

Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Tweak hyperparameters and model architecture as needed for optimal results.

Results Interpretation: Provide insights into the model's predictions, highlighting any challenges or areas of improvement.
